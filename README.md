# HumanCopy

HumanCopy is a computer vision–based project that detects a human, analyzes key body points, and creates a real-time replica that follows the same movements with a short delay.

## Project Overview
HumanCopy first detects a human in the frame. After detection, it identifies specific key points (areas) on the human body such as joints or movement points.  
Using these points, the system generates a replica that imitates the human’s movements **exactly as performed**, with a delay of **0.07 seconds**.

## How It Works
1. Human detection using computer vision techniques  
2. Identification of key body points  
3. Generation of a replica based on detected points  
4. Replica follows the exact human movement after a 0.07-second delay
